# ADR-001: Minimal Platform Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

LLM Hub requires a platform architecture that supports MCP bridge services while maintaining simplicity and avoiding over-engineering. The platform must be extensible but start with minimal complexity.

## Decision

Adopt a minimal platform architecture with:
- Platform core for contract loading and validation
- Runtime components for logging, lifecycle, and error handling
- Contract-based service definitions
- Separation between platform and units

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal initial complexity
- Extensible foundation
- Contract-driven development

### Negative
- May require refactoring as requirements grow
- Limited initial feature set

### Neutral
- Requires discipline to maintain simplicity
