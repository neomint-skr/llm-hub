# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of LLM Hub with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in LLM Hub, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@your-domain.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Subject**: Include "LLM Hub Security Vulnerability" in the subject line
3. **Encryption**: Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Version, OS, configuration details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots if applicable
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will coordinate public disclosure after the fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Authentication
- **Change Default API Key**: Never use the default `changeme` API key in production
- **Strong API Keys**: Use cryptographically secure random keys (32+ characters)
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
- **Environment Variables**: Store keys in environment variables, not code

```bash
# Generate secure API key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Set in environment
export API_KEY="your-secure-random-key-here"
```

#### Network Security
- **Firewall**: Configure firewall to restrict access to necessary ports only
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production (configure reverse proxy)
- **Internal Networks**: Deploy on internal networks when possible
- **VPN**: Use VPN for remote access to LLM Hub instances

#### Container Security
- **Regular Updates**: Keep Docker and base images updated
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits
- **Non-Root**: Services run as non-root users in containers
- **Read-Only**: Use read-only filesystems where possible

#### Configuration Security
- **Disable Auth**: Never disable authentication in production (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits for your use case
- **Logging**: Enable logging but avoid logging sensitive data
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual access patterns

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs and parameters
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: Require authentication for all sensitive endpoints
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS**: Configure CORS appropriately for your use case

#### Data Security
- **No Sensitive Data**: Don't log API keys, tokens, or user data
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for data in transit and at rest
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Validation**: Validate all data types and ranges

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Single API Key**: Current implementation supports only one API key per deployment
2. **In-Memory Rate Limiting**: Rate limits reset on service restart
3. **HTTP Only**: Default configuration uses HTTP (HTTPS requires reverse proxy)
4. **Local Storage**: No persistent storage encryption by default

### Planned Improvements

- Multi-tenant authentication system
- Persistent rate limiting with Redis
- Built-in HTTPS support
- Enhanced audit logging
- Role-based access control

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Bearer token authentication for all API endpoints
- Configurable authentication bypass for development only
- Request validation and sanitization

### Rate Limiting
- Per-token rate limiting (default: 60 requests/minute)
- Configurable limits via environment variables
- Automatic request rejection when limits exceeded

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Health checks for service monitoring
- Network isolation between services

### Logging and Monitoring
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- No sensitive data in logs
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Request/response tracking for debugging

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning
We regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip-audit

# Container images
docker scout cves

# GitHub security advisories
Dependabot alerts
```

### Security Testing
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Penetration testing (planned)

### Update Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Development**: Create and test fix
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing
4. **Release**: Coordinated release with advisory
5. **Communication**: Notify users of security updates

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. **Detection**: Identify potential security incident
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Limit exposure and prevent spread
4. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and affected systems
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and implement fixes
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

### Communication
- Security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities
- Release notes for security fixes
- User notification for critical issues
- Transparency in security practices

## Compliance and Standards

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement secure coding practices
- Regular security reviews and audits
